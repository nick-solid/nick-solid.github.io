## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpeg">

Hi! I am a graduating MBA student at MIT Sloan and a consultant in the Strategic Operations practice of [Kearney](https://www.kearney.com/). I help companies to efficiently move their products across their logistics networks.

I previously worked on the electrification of ABInBev's APAC truck fleet in Shanghai, and on the emerging Digital Financial Services landscape in Southeast Asia with Google and Grab. 

I graduated with my BA in Economics from the University of Chicago.
