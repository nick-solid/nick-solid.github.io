## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi! I am a graduating MBA student at MIT Sloan. I am a consultant in the Strategic Operations practice of [Kearney](https://www.kearney.com/). I work on helping companies to efficiently move their products across their logistics networks.

I have previously also looked at the emerging Digital Financial landscape in Southeast Asia with Google and Grab, and also looked at fully electric and hydrogen semi-tractors at AB InBev in Shanghai. I graduated with my BA in Economics from the University of Chicago.
