<p>Hi! I am a graduating MBA student at MIT Sloan. I am a consultant in the Strategic Operations practice of <a href="https://www.kearney.com/">Kearney</a>. I work on helping companies to efficiently move their products across their logistics networks.</p>

<p>I have previously also looked at the emerging Digital Financial landscape in Southeast Asia with Google and Grab, and also looked at fully electric and hydrogen semi-tractors at AB InBev in Shanghai. I graduated with my BA in Economics from the University of Chicago.</p>
